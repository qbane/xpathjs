XPathJS
=======

XPathJS is a pure JavaScript implementation of [XPath 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/) and [DOM Level 3 XPath](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-XPath/) specifications.

Features
--------

  * Works in all major browsers: IE8+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera
  * Supports XML namespaces!
  * No external dependencies, include just a single .js file
  * Regression tested against [hundreds of unit test cases](http://www.pokret.org/xpathjs/tests/).
  * Works in pages served as both, _text/html_ and _application/xhtml+xml_ content types.
  * [Benchmarked](http://www.pokret.org/xpathjs/benchmark/) against other XPath implementations.

Getting Started
--------

  1. `npm install xpathjs` then `import 'xpathjs'` at the top of your js file<br><br>
     or<br><br>
     Add `<script src="https://unpkg.com/@mass-edge/xpathjs@0.2.2/dist/xpathjs.min.js"></script>` in the \<head> of your HTML document.

  1. Initialize XPathJS:
      ```javascript
      // bind XPath methods to document and window objects
      // NOTE: This will overwrite native XPath implementation if it exists
      window.XPathJS.bindDomLevel3XPath();
      ```

  1. You can now use XPath expressions to query the DOM:
      ```javascript
      var result = document.evaluate(
          '//ul/li/text()', // XPath expression
          document, // context node
          null, // namespace resolver
          XPathResult.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE
      );

      // loop through results
      for (var i = 0; i < result.snapshotLength; i++) {
          var node = result.snapshotItem(i);
          alert(node.nodeValue);
      }
      ```

Take a look at some [working examples](http://www.pokret.org/xpathjs/examples/) to get a better idea of how to use XPathJS.

We would strongly recommend for you to take a look at the [**CAVEATS**](https://github.com/andrejpavlovic/xpathjs/blob/master/CAVEATS.md) document to get a better understanding of XPathJS limitations.

More examples, configuration options, and caveat info coming soon...

Background
--------

So how did XPathJS come to be? Well originally we were looking for an implementation of a cross-browser [XForms](http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/) solution in hopes to alleviate the pain and complexity that comes with creating normal HTML forms. Unfortunately, we found out that there is neither an XForms engine that is fully implemented, nor does it support all browsers. So we thought, ok let's try to build our own! Then we realized that XForms makes extensive use of XPath. And again, we could not find a fully functional cross-browser XPath implementation. Long story short, that's how XPathJS was born.

By releasing XPathJS, we hope to help promote the adoption of open standards in the community.
